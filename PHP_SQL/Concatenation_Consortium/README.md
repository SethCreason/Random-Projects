# Concatenation Consortium
# Description:  
A MySQL database-driven ecommerce website written in PHP, utilizing the MVC design pattern.  Items added to the database (either manually or via the hidden admin control panel) will immediately change the content of the website.  For example, all items added will appear on the product page.  Item's with a given discount will appear on the home page as being a "promotional item."  Item images (jpg only) must be added manually, and must have a name matching the item's Product Code (eg., curlyBracket.jpg).
